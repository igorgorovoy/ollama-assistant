**Python Code:**
```python
import streamlit as st
import olmannabot

# Set up the Olmanna 3 bot connection
bot = olmannabot.OlmannaBot()
bot.connect()

# Create a Streamlit app
st.set_page_title("Olmanna Chat")

with st.expander("Chat"):
    # Input field for user messages
    message_input = st.text_input("Message", max_chars=200)

    # Send button to send the message to the bot
    send_button = st.button("Send")

    # Output field to display the bot's response
    output_text = ""
    if send_button:
        # Get the user's input message
        message = message_input

        # Send the message to the Olmanna 3 bot
        response = bot.send_message(message)

        # Update the output text with the bot's response
        output_text += f"**You:** {message}\n"
        output_text += f"**Bot:** {response}\n"

# Display the output text in a Streamlit text area
st.text_area("Output", value=output_text, height=200)
```
This code creates a simple chat application using `streamlit` that connects to a locally-installed
Olmanna 3 bot. The user can input messages and send them to the bot, which will respond with its
own message.

**How it works:**

1. The code sets up an Olmanna 3 bot connection using the `olmannabot` library.
2. It creates a Streamlit app with an expander panel for the chat functionality.
3. The user can input messages in a text field and send them to the bot using a button.
4. When the user sends a message, the code sends the message to the Olmanna 3 bot using the
`send_message` method.
5. The bot's response is received and displayed in an output text area below the input field.

**Note:** This is just a basic example, and you may want to add additional features such as
handling multiple messages at once, displaying the chat history, or implementing more advanced AI
integration with Olmanna 3.

>>> add google auth for this site
To add Google authentication (OAuth) to your Streamlit app, you'll need to:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Platform project**: Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new
project.
2. **Enable the OAuth 2.0 API**: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the APIs & Services
page, search for "OAuth 2.0", and click on the result. Then, click on the "Enable" button.
3. **Create credentials for your app**: In the Credentials page, click on "Create Credentials" and
then select "OAuth client ID". Choose "Web application" as the application type, enter a name for
your client ID, and specify authorized JavaScript origins (`http://localhost:8501` in this case).
4. **Add the Google OAuth library to your project**: Install the `google-auth-oauthlib` package
using pip: `pip install google-auth-oauthlib`
5. **Modify your Streamlit code to use Google authentication**:

Here's an updated version of your Streamlit code that includes Google authentication:
```python
import streamlit as st
import olmannabot
from google.oauth2 import google_auth_library
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Set up the Olmanna 3 bot connection
bot = olmannabot.OlmannaBot()
bot.connect()

# Create a Streamlit app
st.set_page_title("Olmanna Chat")
with st.expander("Chat"):
    # Input field for user messages
    message_input = st.text_input("Message", max_chars=200)

    # Send button to send the message to the bot
    send_button = st.button("Send")

    # Output field to display the bot's response
    output_text = ""

    if send_button:
        # Get the user's input message
        message = message_input

        # Authenticate with Google using the OAuth client ID and secrets
        CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
        REDIRECT_URI = "http://localhost:8501"

        flow = google_auth_library.flow_from_client_secrets(CLIENT_ID, scopes=["openid", "email"])
        request = Request()
        credentials = flow.run_authentication(request)
        access_token = credentials.access_token

        # Send the message to the Olmanna 3 bot
        response = bot.send_message(message)

        # Update the output text with the bot's response
        output_text += f"**You:** {message}\n"
        output_text += f"**Bot:** {response}\n"

# Display the output text in a Streamlit text area
st.text_area("Output", value=output_text, height=200)
```
This code uses the `google-auth-oauthlib` package to authenticate with Google using an OAuth
client ID and secrets. The `flow_from_client_secrets` method is used to create a flow object that
represents the authentication flow, and then the `run_authentication` method is called to run the
authentication flow and obtain an access token.

The access token is then used to send the message to the Olmanna 3 bot using the `send_message`
method. Finally, the output text is updated with the bot's response.

**Note:** You'll need to replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"` and `"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"` with your actual
Google OAuth client ID and secrets.

>>> if i don't want to use ollamabot
If you don't want to use Olmanna Bot, you can simply remove the `olmannabot` library and replace
it with a different text-based AI model or chatbot that you prefer.

Here are some alternatives:

1. **Dialogflow**: Google's Dialogflow is a popular platform for building conversational
interfaces. You can integrate it with your Streamlit app to create a chatbot.
2. **Rasa**: Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework that allows you to build custom
chatbots. You can use it to integrate with your Streamlit app.
3. **Watson Assistant**: IBM Watson Assistant is a cloud-based AI platform that provides natural
language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities. You can use it to create a chatbot
for your Streamlit app.
4. **Microsoft Bot Framework**: Microsoft Bot Framework is a set of tools for building
conversational interfaces. You can use it to create a chatbot for your Streamlit app.

To integrate one of these alternatives with your Streamlit app, you'll need to:

1. Choose the AI platform or library that best fits your needs.
2. Follow their documentation and tutorials to learn how to use the platform or library.
3. Modify your Streamlit code to use the chosen AI platform or library instead of Olmanna Bot.

Here's an example of how you might modify your Streamlit code to use Dialogflow:
```python
import streamlit as st
from dialogflow import Dialogflow

# Set up your Dialogflow agent
agent = Dialogflow('YOUR_AGENT_ID', 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID')

with st.expander("Chat"):
    message_input = st.text_input("Type a message:")
    send_button = st.button("Send")

    if send_button:
        # Get the user's input message
        message = message_input

        # Use Dialogflow to respond to the user's message
        response = agent.response(message)

        output_text = f"**Bot:** {response}"
        st.text_area("Output", value=output_text, height=200)
```
This code uses the Dialogflow library to create a chatbot that responds to user input. You'll need
to replace `YOUR_AGENT_ID` and `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Dialogflow agent ID and project
ID.

>>> no i want use onle request to ollama which installed on my server
In that case, you can modify the code to make a single request to Olmanna (which is installed on
your server) using the `requests` library in Python.

Here's an updated example:
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

# Set up your Olmanna API endpoint
OLMANN_API_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:5000'  # Replace with your actual Olmanna API endpoint

with st. expander("Chat"):
    message_input = st.text_input("Type a message:")
    send_button = st.button("Send")

    if send_button:
        # Get the user's input message
        message = message_input

        # Make a request to Olmanna API with the user's message
        response = requests.post(f"{OLMANN_API_ENDPOINT}/message", json={"text": message})

        # Extract the response from the Olmanna API
        output_text = response.json()["response"]

        st.text_area("Output", value=output_text, height=200)
```
In this code, we're using the `requests` library to make a POST request to the Olmanna API
endpoint with the user's input message. The response from the Olmanna API is then extracted and
displayed in the Streamlit app.

Note that you'll need to replace `http://localhost:5000` with your actual Olmanna API endpoint.
